## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Yellow (#F6BB15) is used for highlights, CTAs, and accent elements to draw attention and create a sense of energy.
- Background color: Black (#000000) is used to create a sleek, high-contrast backdrop, enhancing the vibrancy of the yellow and the clarity of white text. It brings to mind the darkness inside one's body before it has been cleansed, then gives way to energy and sunshine.
- Accent color: A slightly darker shade of yellow (#D9A80E) is used for button borders and hovers, adding depth and interactivity. It is of the same hue as the primary yellow, but is subtly different in brightness to offer affordances.
- Headline font: 'Poppins' Bold is used for titles and buttons to ensure a strong and clear visual hierarchy. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Body font: 'Poppins' Light is used for paragraphs, descriptions, and labels, providing a lighter, more readable text for extended content. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Icons are simple, clean, and typically monochromatic, with occasional yellow accents for emphasis. They should be easily understandable and support the textual content.
- The layout features wide, horizontal sections with cards organized in grids. Responsiveness is crucial, with 3-4 columns on desktop, 2 on tablet, and 1 on mobile. CTAs are full-width on mobile.
